-------------------------JAVA TEST---------------------------

1.which sorted collection have tou used?

A: collection.sort method using the sorted collection.

2.what are some alternatives to inheritance? 

A: -> is a relationship is the alternative of the inheritance.
->	delegation is the alternative of the inheritance.

3.what is the covarient method overriding?

A: Only non-primitive return types can use a covariant return type, 
   Subclass methods can override base class methods by altering the return type of the overriding method.
   The term ‘method overloading’ refers to changing a method’s arguments.

4.difference between LinkedList and ArrayList?

A:		ArrayList												LinkedList
	1.ArrayList Internally stored dynamic array			1.LinkedList Internally stored circular list
		in the element.											array in the element.
	2.ArrayList is using faster read operation.			2.LinkedList lower in read operation.
	3.ArrayList is slower in write operation.			3.LinkedList faster in write operation.
	4.this class implements and interface therefore 	4.this class both implements list interface 
	  therefore act as a linkedlist.							therefore act as a queue.
	
5.difference between Listiterator and iterator in java ?
A : 			Listiterator									
	
	
	1.ListIterator can be used in List collection only. 
	
	2.methods of ListIterator interface are
	add(), hasNext(), hasPrevious() and remove().
	
	3.ListIterator is an interface that extends 
	the Iterator interface and we can traverse the elements 
	in both forward and backward directions.
	 
	 
				iterator
				
	 1.an iterator is an interface in Java						
	and we can traverse the elements of a list 
	in a forward direction.
	
	 2.The methods of Iterator interface are
	hasNext(), next() and remove() .
	
	3.An Iterator can be used in these collection types like List, Set, 
		and Queue.
	
6.what is memory leackage in java?

A:memeory leackage is the situation when the garbage collector does not recognige the unused objects.
and the remain in memory is indefinetly thet reduce the amount of memory allocated to the application.

7.input [45,333,76,29,900,23,474,654,29,454]
  output min->23
		max->900
		class Array
		{
		public static void main(String args[]){
		int a[]={45,333,76,29,900,23,474,654,29,454};
		int temp=0;
		if(a[i]>a[j] && a.max[i])
		{
		for(int i=0;i<a.length; i++)
		{
		for(int j=i+1; j<a.length;j++)
		{
		temp=a[i];
		a[i]=a[j];
		a[j]=temp;
		}
		}
		System.out.println(a.max[i]);
		System.out.println(a[a.length-1]);		
		}
		}
		}

8.explain static binding and instance binding in polymorphism

A: polymorphism:object behaving in given instance of time is called polymorphism
	polymorphism two types
	1.compiletime polymorphism - method overloading.
	2.runtime polymorphism - method overriding.
	
method overloading: it means multiple methods in class is passing argument in the parameter of the method.

method overriding: in the class method signature is same but difference in the implementation.
